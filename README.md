# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and popular two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. In this game, one player uses the symbol ‘X’ and the other uses ‘O’. Players take turns marking empty spaces on the grid. The goal is to be the first to form a straight line of three marks — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
